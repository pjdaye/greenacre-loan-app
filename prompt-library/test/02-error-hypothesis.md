# Define Error Hypothesis

**Author:** Philip Daye (@pjdaye)  
**Language:** N/A  
**Use Case:** Risk Analysis  
**Tags:** risk-analysis, error-hypothesis  
**Parameters:**  

- `product_under_test`: The name of the product under test
- `number_to_output`: The request number of outputs

## Prompt

Error hypotheses are assumptions about potential failure points within a system that help guide test data selection and scenario creation. Common examples include:

- **Decisions:** Issues in logic (e.g., off-by-one errors, faulty decision-making).
- **Translations:** Errors in data conversion between system layers.
- **Assumptions:** Failures due to unverified or invalid assumptions.

Do not limit your analysis to these examples. Based on the feature requirements for the `{{product_under_test}}`, independently evaluate and identify additional error hypothesesâ€”including performance, concurrency, integration, security, and domain-specific risks.

For each identified error hypothesis, provide a brief justification and rank the top `{{number_to_output}}` risks based on both likelihood and potential impact.

## **Instructions for Use:**

1. **Identify Parameters:** Locate the placeholders in the prompt marked with {{brackets}}. These are the parameters that you need to customize.
2. **Customize Values:** Replace the placeholder parameters with the appropriate values for your use case. Refer to the "Parameters" section for more details.
3. **Run the Prompt:** Once customized, input the prompt into the Generative AI tool to get the desired outcome.
4. Independently analyze and rank risks; ensure that the model expands beyond the provided examples.

## **Additional Notes:**

- Add any additional error models for consideration.
