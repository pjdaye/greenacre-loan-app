# Feature: Loan Approval

## Charters for Exploratory Testing

Exploratory testing is essential for uncovering issues that automated tests might miss. Below are five exploratory testing charters targeting critical areas of the Loan Application feature.

1. **Title:** Assessing User Interface Responsiveness

    **Explore** the responsiveness of the loan application form **using** various devices and screen sizes **to discover** UI inconsistencies, layout issues, or usability problems that may affect user experience.

2. **Title:** Validating Error Handling Mechanisms

    **Explore** how the application handles invalid inputs and unexpected user behaviors **using** boundary values and malformed data **to discover** inadequate error messages, unhandled exceptions, or security vulnerabilities.

3. **Title:** Evaluating Performance Under Load

    **Explore** the application's performance when multiple loan applications are submitted simultaneously **using** stress testing techniques **to discover** performance bottlenecks, scalability issues, or potential crashes under high load conditions.

4. **Title:** Verifying Data Persistence Without Backend Database

    **Explore** how the application manages loan application data **using** various scenarios of data submission, retrieval, and session management **to discover** issues related to data loss, inconsistencies, or improper handling due to the absence of a backend database.

5. **Title:** Security Testing for Data Transmission

    **Explore** the security of data transmission between the frontend and backend **using** network interception tools and techniques **to discover** potential vulnerabilities, such as data leaks, inadequate encryption, or susceptibility to injection attacks.
