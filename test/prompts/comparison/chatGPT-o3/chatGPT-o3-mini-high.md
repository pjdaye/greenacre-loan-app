## 1. [Context Setup and Objective](../../01-context-setup-and-objectives.md)

(Reasoned for 8 seconds)

Below is a comprehensive set of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) test cases for the Loan Application feature. These test cases have been designed with a focus on both the business objectives—such as ensuring accurate data collection, correct loan processing, and a smooth user experience—and the operational constraints imposed by the web-based, distributed Docker environment. In designing these cases, established test design techniques like **equivalence partitioning**, **boundary value analysis**, and **pairwise testing** have been applied to ensure broad and effective coverage.

### Feature: Loan Application Submission

#### Scenario: Borrower Submits a Valid Loan Application

```gherkin
Feature: Loan Application Submission

  Scenario: Borrower submits a valid loan application
    Given a borrower with complete and valid personal, financial, and employment information
    When the borrower fills in the loan application form with valid details and submits the application
    Then the system should accept the application
    And a confirmation message should be displayed with the application ID and next steps
```

*This scenario ensures that the basic business objective—successful submission by a borrower—is met.*

---

#### Scenario Outline: Input Field Validation with Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis

```gherkin
  Scenario Outline: Validate loan application input fields using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis
    Given a borrower accessing the loan application form
    When the borrower enters a loan amount of "<loan_amount>", a credit score of "<credit_score>", and an annual income of "<income>"
    And submits the application
    Then the system should "<result>" the application

    Examples:
      | loan_amount | credit_score | income  | result                                     |
      | 5000        | 720          | 50000   | accept                                     |
      | 4999        | 720          | 50000   | reject with error "Loan amount too low"    | # Boundary: just below minimum acceptable amount
      | 500000      | 720          | 50000   | reject with error "Loan amount too high"   | # Boundary: above maximum acceptable amount
      | 5000        | 299          | 50000   | reject with error "Credit score too low"   | # Boundary: below valid credit score range
      | 5000        | 851          | 50000   | reject with error "Credit score too high"  | # Boundary: above valid credit score range
      | 5000        | 720          | 0       | reject with error "Income must be greater than 0" |
```

*Here, equivalence partitioning divides valid and invalid ranges for loan amounts, credit scores, and incomes. Boundary value analysis is applied by testing just below and above the defined limits.*

---

#### Scenario: Submission with Missing Mandatory Fields

```gherkin
  Scenario: Submission with missing mandatory fields
    Given a borrower accessing the loan application form
    When the borrower submits the form without entering required fields such as personal identification, income, or employment details
    Then the system should display error messages for each missing mandatory field
    And the application should not be submitted until all required fields are completed
```

*This scenario ensures the system enforces required field validations to meet business compliance and data integrity objectives.*

---

#### Scenario: Loan Officer Reviews Application in a Distributed Environment

```gherkin
  Scenario: Loan officer reviews a new loan application
    Given a loan officer logged into the system dashboard
    When a new loan application is submitted by a borrower
    Then the system should display the new application in the loan officer's review queue
    And the application status should be updated consistently across all distributed Docker containers
```

*This scenario checks that loan officers can reliably access and review applications in a distributed environment—a key operational requirement.*

---

#### Scenario: Concurrent Loan Application Submissions

```gherkin
  Scenario: Handling concurrent loan application submissions
    Given multiple borrowers accessing the loan application system concurrently
    When all borrowers submit their loan applications simultaneously
    Then the system should process each submission correctly without data loss or conflict
    And the overall performance should meet predefined response time thresholds
```

*This scenario validates the system's ability to handle high concurrency, ensuring robust performance under load.*

---

#### Scenario: Docker Container Failure and Recovery

```gherkin
  Scenario: Recovery from Docker container failure during application processing
    Given the application is running in a distributed Docker container environment
    When one container fails during the processing of a loan application
    Then the system should automatically re-route the processing to a healthy container
    And ensure no loss of data or interruption in the loan application process
```

*This operational test ensures the resilience of the system under container failures—a critical aspect of distributed deployments.*

---

#### Scenario: Pairwise Testing for Field Combinations

```gherkin
  Scenario: Validate combinations of loan types and employment statuses using pairwise testing
    Given a borrower accessing the loan application form
    When the borrower selects a combination of "<loan_type>" and "<employment_status>"
    And enters all other required valid information
    Then the system should "<outcome>" the application based on the combination

    Examples:
      | loan_type     | employment_status | outcome                                          |
      | Home Loan     | Employed          | accept                                           |
      | Home Loan     | Self-Employed     | accept                                           |
      | Car Loan      | Employed          | accept                                           |
      | Car Loan      | Self-Employed     | accept                                           |
      | Personal Loan | Employed          | accept                                           |
      | Personal Loan | Unemployed        | reject with error "Unemployed applicants not eligible" |
```

*Pairwise testing helps in covering the various combinations of input conditions to ensure that the system correctly handles diverse business rules.*

---

### Feature: Data Persistence and Audit Logging

#### Scenario: Audit Logging for Loan Application Submission

```gherkin
Feature: Loan Application Data Persistence and Audit Logging

  Scenario: Verify audit logging on loan application submission
    Given a borrower submits a complete loan application
    When the application is processed by the system
    Then an audit log entry should be created with the borrower's ID, submission timestamp, and application status
    And the audit log should be available for review by authorized personnel
```

*This scenario supports the business objective of traceability and accountability in loan processing.*

---

- **Business Objectives:** Borrowers can submit valid applications, errors are caught early, and loan officers can reliably process applications.
- **Operational Constraints:** The application performs reliably under distributed deployment conditions, handles concurrent requests gracefully, and recovers from container failures.
- **Test Design Techniques:** Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and pairwise testing are explicitly applied to validate input data and system behavior.

By following these test scenarios, the testing team can achieve comprehensive test coverage, early bug detection, and effective risk mitigation for the Greenacre Loan Application app.

## 2. [Define Error Hypothesis](../../02-define-error-hypothesis-prompt.md)

(Reasoned for 9 seconds)

Below is an evaluation of additional error hypotheses for the Greenacre Loan Application feature, followed by a ranking of the top three potential areas of risk based on both their likelihood and impact.

---

### 1. Data Consistency and Concurrency in a Distributed Environment

- **Likelihood:** High  
- **Impact:** High  
- **Explanation:**  
  The distributed nature of the application—running in multiple Docker containers—combined with concurrent loan application submissions from multiple borrowers increases the risk of race conditions and synchronization issues. Data inconsistencies or conflicts might arise if multiple processes attempt to update shared resources simultaneously. Such issues can lead to incorrect loan decision processing or even data loss.  
- **Testing Approaches:**  
  - **Concurrency Testing:** Simulate simultaneous submissions to uncover race conditions.  
  - **Stress Testing:** Push the system to its performance limits to observe how it handles high load.  
  - **Pairwise Testing:** Validate different combinations of concurrent inputs to ensure consistency.

---

### 2. API Integration and Data Transformation Errors

- **Likelihood:** High  
- **Impact:** Medium-High  
- **Explanation:**  
  The separation between the React front end and the Node.js/Express back end introduces potential risks in API integration. Errors might occur during data serialization/deserialization, transformation of user inputs into database-friendly formats, or even mismatches in expected data types. These issues, while sometimes subtle, can lead to incorrect processing of loan applications.  
- **Testing Approaches:**  
  - **Integration Testing:** Validate that data flows correctly between the front end and back end.  
  - **Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis:** Test data ranges and edge cases to ensure proper handling of numeric and textual inputs.  
  - **Translation Testing:** Ensure that all data transformations—from user input to database records—are accurate and complete.

---

### 3. Fault Tolerance and Resilience in Container Orchestration

- **Likelihood:** Medium  
- **Impact:** High  
- **Explanation:**  
  Given that the application relies on Docker containers in a distributed deployment, there is a significant risk associated with container failures. Inadequate failover mechanisms or flawed container orchestration can lead to downtime, disrupted transactions, or incomplete processing of loan applications. If one container fails, the system must seamlessly reroute processes to maintain continuity.  
- **Testing Approaches:**  
  - **Fault Injection/Chaos Testing:** Deliberately cause container failures to verify that the system can recover gracefully.  
  - **Resilience Testing:** Ensure that load balancing and automated recovery mechanisms function correctly under failure conditions.  
  - **Scenario-Based Testing:** Simulate real-world failure scenarios to assess the system's robustness and data integrity.

---

### Summary (Risk Analysis)

The top three areas of risk identified are:

1. **Data Consistency and Concurrency:** Highly likely and very impactful due to the distributed processing of simultaneous loan applications.
2. **API Integration and Data Transformation:** High likelihood of subtle yet critical errors stemming from data handling between the front end and back end.
3. **Fault Tolerance in Container Orchestration:** Medium likelihood but high impact, where failures in container management can disrupt the entire application process.

Addressing these risk areas through targeted test design—including concurrency, integration, and fault injection tests—will be essential in ensuring robust performance and reliability of the Greenacre Loan Application app.

## 3. [Define Feature Requirements](../../03-define-feature-requirements-prompt.md)

(Reasoned for 7 seconds)

Below is a concise summary of the critical features, acceptance criteria, and potential areas for risk-based testing based on the provided requirements.

---

### Key Functional Areas

- **Input Validation:**  
  - **Borrower FICO:** Must be within 300–850.  
  - **Co-Borrower FICO:** Either “None” or within 300–850.  
  - **Property Type:** Must be one of SFR, Condo, Townhouse, Multi-Family, or Commercial (with restrictions on some loan programs).  
  - **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** A percentage between 0% and 100%, with stricter limits (≤80%) for Jumbo and Conventional programs.  
  - **Loan Amount:** General range USD 50,000–1,000,000; further limited for Jumbo (USD 418,000–1,000,000) and FHA (USD 50,000–418,000).  
  - **Loan Type:** Should be either Fixed or Adjustable, though FHA only allows Fixed.  
  - **Loan Period:** Allowed values vary by program (e.g., FHA only allows 15 or 30 years).

- **Loan Program Determination:**  
  - **Multiple Program Eligibility:** The system may qualify a single application for more than one program (Jumbo, Conventional, FHA).  
  - **Precedence Rule:** When multiple approvals exist, the output follows the order: Jumbo, Conventional, then FHA.

- **Output Specifications:**  
  - **Approved Loans:** Return values include Approval, the applicable Program, and the associated Rate.  
  - **Denied Loans:** Return Denial along with “NA” for both Program and Rate.

---

### Potential Edge Cases & Special Conditions

- **Boundary Conditions:**  
  - Values exactly at the lower or upper limits (e.g., Borrower FICO of 300 and 850, Loan Amount of 50,000 and 1,000,000).  
  - Off-by-one errors around these boundaries (e.g., 299 or 851 for FICO).

- **Combination of Inputs:**  
  - Applications where one parameter qualifies for one program but another disqualifies it (e.g., valid for Conventional but not for FHA due to property type or loan type).  
  - Cases where both borrower and co-borrower FICO scores are provided, especially near the threshold values.

- **Data Translation/Transformation:**  
  - Ensuring that input data from the web form is correctly parsed and validated before processing.
  - Accurate conversion of percentages for LTV and monetary values for Loan Amounts.

- **Decision Logic:**  
  - Correctly applying the precedence order when multiple loan program criteria are met.  
  - Ensuring that any deviation or misinterpretation of criteria (e.g., misapplying the loan period restrictions) is caught.

---

### Areas Requiring Special Attention (Risk-Based Focus)

1. **Data Consistency and Input Validation:**  
   - **Risk:** Incorrect or imprecise validations (e.g., off-by-one errors, misinterpretation of “None” for co-borrower FICO) can lead to wrong approvals.  
   - **Testing Focus:** Employ equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis to rigorously test input ranges and edge conditions.

2. **Complex Decision Logic for Program Selection:**  
   - **Risk:** Overlapping eligibility criteria might lead to incorrect program assignment or wrong precedence application.  
   - **Testing Focus:** Use pairwise testing to cover different combinations of input conditions and validate that the system returns the correct program based on the predefined order.

3. **Data Transformation and API Integrity:**  
   - **Risk:** Misalignment between the UI inputs and back-end processing (e.g., errors in data transformation, incorrect data mapping) might result in inaccurate loan decisions.  
   - **Testing Focus:** Integration tests and data translation validations to ensure the complete and correct flow of data from the front end to the loan decision engine.

---

### Summary (Requirements Review)

The main components to validate include:

- **Input Field Validations:** Ensure every field adheres to its defined valid range or list of accepted values.
- **Loan Program Criteria:** Confirm that the criteria for Jumbo, Conventional, and FHA loans are correctly applied and that the proper precedence is used when an application qualifies for more than one program.
- **Output Consistency:** Verify that approved applications return the correct status, program, and rate, and that denied applications return appropriate placeholder values.
- **Edge Cases:** Specifically target boundary values, off-by-one errors, and mixed input scenarios.
- **System Integration and Data Transformation:** Test the integrity of data as it moves between the React front end, Node.js/Express back end, and any underlying data stores.

Special attention should be given to the complex decision logic and data transformation processes, as these are critical points where subtle errors could lead to significant business impact. Adopting a risk-based testing approach that emphasizes these areas will help ensure robust and accurate loan application processing.

## 4. [Initial Test Case Generation](../../04-initial-test-case-generation-prompt.md)

(Reasoned for 13 seconds)

Below is an initial draft of test assets for the Loan Application feature, incorporating the provided context, error hypotheses, and detailed requirements.

---

## 1. BDD Gherkin Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Valid Loan Application (Conventional)

```gherkin
Feature: Loan Application Submission

  Scenario: Borrower submits a valid application for Conventional loan
    Given a borrower with a Borrower FICO of 700 and a Co-Borrower FICO of 600
    And the property type is "SFR"
    And the Loan-to-Value is "75%"
    And the Loan Amount is "200000"
    And the Loan Type is "Fixed"
    And the Loan Period is "30"
    When the borrower submits the loan application form
    Then the system should return "Approval", "Conventional", and the appropriate rate
```

*Test Design Techniques: Equivalence Partitioning (valid FICO, LTV, Loan Amount ranges) and Boundary Value Analysis for numeric inputs.*

---

### Test Case 2: Edge Case for Boundary Values (FICO Scores and Loan Amount)

```gherkin
  Scenario: Loan application with boundary values for FICO and Loan Amount
    Given a borrower with a Borrower FICO of "300" and a Co-Borrower FICO of "300"
    And the property type is "Condo"
    And the Loan-to-Value is "80%"
    And the Loan Amount is "50000"
    And the Loan Type is "Fixed"
    And the Loan Period is "15"
    When the borrower submits the loan application form
    Then the system should return "Approval", "Conventional", and the appropriate rate
```

*Test Design Techniques: Boundary Value Analysis (testing at the lower limits of FICO and Loan Amount).*

---

### Test Case 3: Multiple Eligibility with Precedence Rule

```gherkin
  Scenario: Loan application qualifies for more than one program
    Given a borrower with a Borrower FICO of "700" and a Co-Borrower FICO of "650"
    And the property type is "Townhouse"
    And the Loan-to-Value is "75%"
    And the Loan Amount is "500000"
    And the Loan Type is "Adjustable"
    And the Loan Period is "40"
    When the borrower submits the loan application form
    Then the system should return "Approval", "Jumbo", and the appropriate rate
```

*Test Design Techniques: Pairwise Testing (combining various valid inputs) and Decision Logic Validation (ensuring correct precedence: Jumbo > Conventional > FHA).*

---

### Test Case 4: Error Condition – Missing Mandatory Fields

```gherkin
  Scenario: Loan application submission with missing required fields
    Given a borrower accesses the loan application form
    When the borrower submits the form without entering Borrower FICO and Loan Amount
    Then the system should display error messages for missing Borrower FICO and Loan Amount
    And the application should not be processed
```

*Test Design Techniques: Negative Testing (ensuring error messages for missing inputs).*

---

## 2. Test Data Generation Instructions

Below is a Python script outline that demonstrates how to generate test data using equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and pairwise combinatorial testing. This script ensures inputs meet constraints (whole, positive numbers) and outputs a reduced, manageable set.

```python
import itertools

# Define valid ranges and values based on requirements
fico_range = range(300, 851)           # Using representative values for FICO
co_fico_options = [None, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 850]
property_types = ["SFR", "Condo", "Townhouse", "Multi-Family", "Commercial"]
ltv_values = [0, 50, 80, 100]            # Use percentage points as examples
loan_amounts = [50000, 100000, 500000, 1000000]  # Representative values
loan_types = ["Fixed", "Adjustable"]
loan_periods = [10, 15, 30, 40]

# Use pairwise combinations for select parameters
parameters = {
    "borrower_fico": [300, 600, 850],    # Boundary and mid-range values
    "co_borrower_fico": [None, 300, 850],
    "property_type": ["SFR", "Condo", "Townhouse"],
    "ltv": [80],                         # Focus on the critical LTV boundary for Conventional/Jumbo
    "loan_amount": [50000, 418000, 500000, 1000000],
    "loan_type": ["Fixed", "Adjustable"],
    "loan_period": [15, 30, 40]
}

# Generate pairwise combinations (simplified version)
keys = list(parameters.keys())
combinations = list(itertools.product(*[parameters[k] for k in keys]))

# Reduce dataset (for example, sample every nth combination if needed)
reduced_test_data = combinations[::max(1, len(combinations)//20)]

print("Generated Test Data Set:")
for test_case in reduced_test_data:
    test_input = dict(zip(keys, test_case))
    print(test_input)
```

*This script uses a simplified pairwise approach (via Cartesian product and then reduction) to generate a manageable set of test cases, while also applying boundary value selections and equivalence classes.*

## 3. Oracle for Expected Results

Below is a pseudocode snippet that acts as an oracle to compute expected results for a given set of input parameters. It uses the business rules to determine the approved program and expected outcomes.

```python
def determine_loan_program(borrower_fico, co_borrower_fico, property_type, ltv, loan_amount, loan_type, loan_period):
    # Define program eligibility functions
    def is_jumbo():
        return (660 <= borrower_fico <= 850 and 
                (co_borrower_fico is None or 620 <= co_borrower_fico <= 850) and 
                property_type in ["SFR", "Condo", "Townhouse", "Multi-Family"] and 
                ltv <= 80 and 
                418000 <= loan_amount <= 1000000 and 
                loan_type in ["Fixed", "Adjustable"] and 
                loan_period in [15, 30, 40])
                
    def is_conventional():
        return (620 <= borrower_fico <= 850 and 
                (co_borrower_fico is None or 520 <= co_borrower_fico <= 850) and 
                property_type in ["SFR", "Condo", "Townhouse", "Multi-Family"] and 
                ltv <= 80 and 
                50000 <= loan_amount <= 1000000 and 
                loan_type in ["Fixed", "Adjustable"] and 
                loan_period in [10, 15, 30, 40])
                
    def is_fha():
        return (300 <= borrower_fico <= 850 and 
                (co_borrower_fico is None or 300 <= co_borrower_fico <= 850) and 
                property_type in ["SFR", "Condo", "Townhouse"] and 
                ltv <= 100 and 
                50000 <= loan_amount <= 418000 and 
                loan_type == "Fixed" and 
                loan_period in [15, 30])
    
    # Determine approved program based on precedence: Jumbo > Conventional > FHA
    if is_jumbo():
        return ("Approval", "Jumbo", "Calculated_Rate")
    elif is_conventional():
        return ("Approval", "Conventional", "Calculated_Rate")
    elif is_fha():
        return ("Approval", "FHA", "Calculated_Rate")
    else:
        return ("Denial", "NA", "NA")

# Example usage:
result = determine_loan_program(borrower_fico=700, co_borrower_fico=650, property_type="Townhouse",
                                ltv=75, loan_amount=500000, loan_type="Adjustable", loan_period=40)
print(result)
```

*This oracle computes expected outcomes based on the input parameters and ensures that the decision logic, including program precedence, is correctly applied.*
