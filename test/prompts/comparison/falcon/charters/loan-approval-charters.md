# Feature: Loan Approval

**Exploratory Testing Charter 1:**

- Focus on scenarios where co-borrowers are involved, particularly edge cases where their credit score is significantly different from the primary borrower's.

- Manually investigate how the system handles property types that are not commonly featured in test cases (e.g., mobile homes).

**Exploratory Testing Charter 2:**

- Conduct a hands-on review of the denial logic, especially edge cases where the applicant narrowly misses criteria for any program.

- Explore user experience aspects around the interface where loan results are displayed, ensuring clarity and correctness.

**Exploratory Testing Charter 3:**

- Investigate how the system handles rapid succession of loan applications, possibly identifying performance or concurrency issues that automated tests may not catch.
