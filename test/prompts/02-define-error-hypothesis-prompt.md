# **Title:** Define Error Hypothesis

---

## **Prompt Structure:**

"Error hypotheses are assumptions about potential failure points within a system that help guide test data selection and scenario creation. Common examples include:

* **Decisions:** Issues in logic (e.g., off-by-one errors, faulty decision-making).
* **Translations:** Errors in data conversion between system layers.
* **Assumptions:** Failures due to unverified or invalid assumptions.

Do not limit your analysis to these examples. Based on the feature requirements for the {{product_under_test}}, independently evaluate and identify additional error hypotheses—including performance, concurrency, integration, security, and domain-specific risks.

For each identified error hypothesis, provide a brief justification and rank the top {{number_to_output}} risks based on both likelihood and potential impact."

Example:
"For the Greenacre Loan Application, besides common error models, consider risks such as performance bottlenecks under high load, concurrency issues during simultaneous submissions, and security vulnerabilities in data handling. Provide a brief rationale for each and rank the top three risks based on likelihood and impact."
