# **Title:** Initial Test Case Generation

---

## **Prompt Structure:**

"Using the provided context, error hypotheses, and feature requirements, generate an initial draft of test assets for the {{product_feature}} feature of the {{product_under_test}}. Your output should include:

1. **BDD Gherkin Test Cases:** Create {{range_of_number}} scenarios with clear, descriptive names that follow the Given/When/Then format. Use Examples and Data Tables where appropriate. For instance, incorporate a table for input parameters, ensuring off-by-one values are included where needed.

2. **Test Data Generation Instructions:** Provide a script or code outline that generates test data using techniques such as equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis (include off-by-one values), and pairwise testing. Use PICT as the default method (with sample input file instructions), and optionally note a built-in Python alternative.

3. **Oracle for Expected Results:** Include a code snippet or pseudocode that either pre-computes expected outcomes or dynamically validates test results based on the generated test data.

4. **Exploratory Testing Charters:** Provide 2–3 charters in bullet form, following this template:
    * **Target:** [what to explore]
    * **Techniques/Resources:** [methods/tools]
    * **Expected Outcome:** [what risks/information to uncover]

Focus on creating a concise yet comprehensive draft that covers core functional areas and identified risks."

Example:
"Scenario: Valid Loan Application with Boundary FICO Values
  Given a borrower with the following attributes:
      | Attribute          | Value        |
      | Borrower FICO      | 299          |
      | Co-Borrower FICO   | 0            |
      | Loan Amount        | 500000       |
      | Loan Type          | Fixed        |
    When the loan application is submitted
    Then the system should reject the application due to invalid FICO score

    Examples:
      | Borrower FICO | Co-Borrower FICO | Loan Amount | Expected Outcome     |
      | 299           | 0                | 500000      | Application Rejected |
      | 300           | 0                | 500000      | Application Approved |
      | 851           | 0                | 500000      | Application Rejected |

Test Data Generation Instructions: Provide a PICT input file that outlines combinations for FICO, Loan Amount, etc., and include a note on merging overlapping boundary values. Optionally, offer a Python snippet as an alternative.
  
Oracle:
 Provide pseudocode that takes input values (e.g., FICO score, Loan Amount) and returns expected values (Approval, Program, Rate), handling edge cases appropriately.
  
Exploratory Testing Charters:

* Explore the loan application submission process under high concurrency to uncover performance bottlenecks.
* Investigate UI behavior when multiple input errors occur simultaneously."
