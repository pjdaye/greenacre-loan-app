## 1. `{{test_case_types}}` Test Cases

Generate `{{number_and_type_of_cases}}` test cases that represent broad categories of tests. These test cases should:

**Example:**
"## Goal

Generate a comprehensive and efficient set of test assets for the Loan Application feature of the Greenacre Loan Application app. The output should include a manageable number of BDD Gherkin test cases, test data generated using pairwise combinatorial techniques (e.g., PICT), and an automated oracle for validating test results.

## 1. BDD Gherkin Test Cases

Generate a small number (3–5) of BDD Gherkin test cases that represent broad categories of tests. These test cases should:

* Cover both valid input data and rejection cases, ensuring they represent a broad class of potential input scenarios (e.g., valid loan approvals, rejections, edge cases).
* Be reusable with a larger range of generated test data.
* Focus on high-priority scenarios, such as valid loan approvals for different programs, and loan rejections due to invalid input.

## 2. Combinatorial Test Data Generation

* Steps for selecting the test data inputs (show your work):
  * In turn, take each Loan Program.
  * Apply Equivalence Class Partitioning to get discrete sets of values
  * Apply Boundary Value Analysis to each Equivalence Class Partition, remembering that Boundary Value Analysis should include the boundary, n, as well as n-1 and n+1.
  * Then merge the boundaries of the partitions for each loan program into a superset of values.
* Provide either PICT input files or Python code to generate hundreds or thousands of rows of combinatorial test data that ensure pairwise coverage of all significant input variables. These variables include:
  * Borrower FICO score, Co-Borrower FICO score, Property Type, Loan Amount, LTV (Loan-to-Value), Loan Type, and Loan Period.
* *Apply pairwise testing techniques to cover all combinations of pairs of input variables, while excluding unrealistic or invalid combinations (e.g., FHA loan amounts above $418,000).
* *Ensure that constraints are included in the input file (or code) to eliminate impossible or irrelevant combinations. Example constraints:
  * If Loan Amount > $418,000, Borrower FICO must be >= 660.
  * FHA Loans are only available with Loan Amount <= $418,000.

## 3. Oracle for Expected Results

* Write a Python script that acts as an oracle for validating the results of each test case. The oracle should:
  * Take the generated input data as parameters (FICO, Loan Amount, LTV, etc.).
  * Return the expected values for Loan Approval, Loan Program, and Interest Rate.
  * Return NA for Loan Program and Interest Rate when Loan Approval is false.
* The oracle should be designed to automatically validate test cases generated by PICT or other combinatorial techniques.

## 4. Workflow and Validation

* The generated Gherkin test cases should handle the output from the combinatorial test data.
* The oracle script should be used to validate the expected results either before or during test execution, ensuring correctness.

## 5. Exploratory Testing

* Create five exploratory testing charters using the following format: Explore [target of testing] with [resources, techniques] to discover [information valuable to the project].
* Focus on areas where manual exploration may uncover risks that automated tests could miss.

## Overall Goal

* Ensure the BDD Gherkin test cases provide a reusable framework for running a wide range of test data.
* The test data should be generated using PICT or a similar tool to provide high coverage through pairwise combinatorial techniques.
* The oracle should provide reliable, automatic validation of the returned values during or after the test execution.
* The exploratory testing charters should target workflows that are either difficult to automate or might be otherwise overlooked."
