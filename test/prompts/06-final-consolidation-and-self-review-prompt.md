# **Title:** Final Consolidation and Self-Review

---

## **Prompt Structure:**

"Consolidate the refined test assets for the {{product_feature}} feature of the {{product_under_test}} into a final, organized test suite. In this final step, perform a comprehensive self-review to ensure:

1. All key scenarios, edge cases, and risk areas have been addressed.
2. Test design techniques (e.g., equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, pairwise testing, decision tables) are consistently applied.
3. The Gherkin test cases are clear, concise, and include well-structured Scenario names, Examples, and Data Tables.

Additionally, review the generated tests for redundant or overlapping stepsâ€”reusing existing steps where applicable.

Incorporate any execution feedback (e.g., failure rates, performance metrics) and human reviewer comments. Include a dedicated section for human feedback, noting any areas where manual intervention is recommended. Output the final consolidated test suite along with reviewer suggestions for further refinement."

Example:
"Final consolidated test suite for the Loan Application feature includes all test cases, with duplicate steps removed and similar scenarios consolidated. A human review section notes that some UI validation tests require further manual review, and execution feedback indicates that boundary tests for FICO values need slight adjustment. The final output is ready for integration into CI/CD."
