# Getting Started with Greenacre Loan App (Next.js)

This project is a migration of the Greenacre Loan App from a React Create App project to a Next.js framework. Below are the updated instructions for working with this project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.\
It correctly bundles Next.js in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more information.

### `npm run start`

Runs the built app in production mode.\
Make sure to run `npm run build` first.
