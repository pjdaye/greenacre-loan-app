## 1. [Context Setup and Objective](../../01-context-setup-and-objectives.md)

Here are comprehensive Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) test cases for the Loan Application feature, explicitly structured using the **Given-When-Then** format. These scenarios incorporate business objectives, operational constraints, and established testing techniques such as **equivalence partitioning**, **boundary value analysis**, and **pairwise testing** for thorough coverage and early defect detection.

---

## Feature: Loan Application Submission

### Scenario: Successful Loan Application Submission

*Ensures a happy-path scenario where all data inputs are valid and correctly processed.*

**Given** a borrower is logged into the Greenacre Loan Application system  
**And** the borrower navigates to the Loan Application form  
**When** the borrower submits a completed form with valid personal, financial, and employment information  
**Then** the system validates the application and displays a successful submission confirmation  
**And** the loan officer receives a notification of the new loan application  

---

### Scenario Outline: Validation of Mandatory Fields (Equivalence Partitioning)

*Ensures mandatory fields are properly validated (Equivalence Partitioning Technique).*

**Given** a borrower is on the Loan Application form  
**When** the borrower attempts to submit the form leaving "<MandatoryField\>" empty  
**Then** the system should not allow submission  
**And** the system should highlight the "<MandatoryField\>" with an appropriate validation error  

| MandatoryField             |
|----------------------------|
| Full Name                  |
| Social Security Number     |
| Income                     |
| Loan Amount Requested      |
| Employment Status          |

---

### Scenario Outline: Boundary Testing for Loan Amount Field (Boundary Value Analysis)

*Validates boundary conditions of the Loan Amount Requested field.*

**Given** the borrower is completing the Loan Application form  
**When** the borrower enters a loan amount of "<LoanAmount\>"
**Then** the system validates the amount and displays "<ValidationResult\>"  

| LoanAmount | ValidationResult                    |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| 999        | "Loan amount must be at least $1000"|
| 1000       | "Valid"                             |
| 50000      | "Valid"                             |
| 50001      | "Loan amount cannot exceed $50000"  |

---

### Scenario: Invalid Social Security Number Format (Format Validation)

*Ensures correct SSN format validation.*

**Given** a borrower is on the Loan Application form  
**When** the borrower enters a Social Security Number in an incorrect format (e.g., "12-3456-789")  
**Then** the system should display an error message indicating invalid SSN format  
**And** the borrower should be unable to submit the application  

---

### Scenario: Session Timeout during Loan Application Submission (Operational Constraint)

*Tests session handling under timeout constraints.*

**Given** a borrower starts a Loan Application and leaves the session inactive for longer than 30 minutes  
**When** the borrower returns and attempts to continue or submit the application  
**Then** the system informs the borrower that the session has expired  
**And** the borrower must log in again to continue  

---

### Scenario Outline: Pairwise Testing of Employment Status and Income Verification

*Uses Pairwise testing to minimize combinations while ensuring coverage.*

**Given** the borrower fills out employment and income information  
**When** the borrower selects "<EmploymentStatus\>" and enters "<Income\>"  
**Then** the system performs "<VerificationAction\>"

| EmploymentStatus | Income   | VerificationAction                          |
|------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Employed         | 50000    | Verify employment through provided employer |
| Self-Employed    | 75000    | Request tax documentation                   |
| Unemployed       | 0        | Prompt for alternate income source          |
| Retired          | 30000    | Request retirement benefit statements       |

---

### Scenario: Concurrent Application Submission (Operational Constraints: Distributed Environment)

*Validates robustness of the system under distributed operations.*

**Given** two borrowers simultaneously submit their respective Loan Applications  
**When** both borrowers click "Submit" at the same time  
**Then** both applications should be processed independently without interference  
**And** both borrowers should receive correct individual submission confirmations  

---

### Scenario: Backend Failure Handling (Fault Tolerance & Dockerized Node.js Backend)

*Tests the system's fault-tolerance when backend services fail.*

**Given** the borrower completes a Loan Application form  
**And** the Node.js backend experiences a container crash or becomes unresponsive  
**When** the borrower clicks "Submit"  
**Then** the system gracefully handles the backend failure  
**And** the borrower receives an appropriate error message advising to try again later  
**And** system monitoring generates an alert for operational teams  

---

### Scenario: Sensitive Data Encryption Verification (Security Testing)

*Ensures data confidentiality and security compliance.*

**Given** a borrower submits a completed Loan Application form  
**When** the data reaches the backend system  
**Then** sensitive fields (SSN, bank account details, income details) must be stored encrypted  
**And** data encryption meets industry-standard compliance (e.g., AES-256 encryption)  

---

### Scenario: Responsive UI Validation (Frontend React Testing)

*Validates frontend responsiveness and usability across devices.*

**Given** the borrower accesses the Loan Application form  
**When** the borrower views the form on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)  
**Then** the form should adapt responsively without usability issues  
**And** all buttons, fields, and instructions remain clear and accessible  

---

## Additional Testing Considerations (Non-Functional Requirements)

- **Performance Testing:**  
  - Validate the application can process at least 500 simultaneous loan application submissions with response times under 3 seconds.

- **Compatibility Testing:**  
  - Ensure the application operates correctly on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

- **Accessibility Testing:**  
  - Verify compliance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines (AA level) to accommodate users with disabilities.

---

These scenarios provide comprehensive coverage, explicitly aligning with business goals (accurate data collection, secure and efficient loan processing), technical considerations (React frontend, Dockerized Node.js backend, distributed environments), and rigorous testing standards for robustness, reliability, and user satisfaction.

## 2. [Define Error Hypothesis](../../02-define-error-hypothesis-prompt.md)

Based on the Greenacre Loan Application feature's context—particularly considering the complexity of distributed deployments, React frontend, Dockerized Node.js backend, business-critical transactions, and sensitivity of data—I’ve identified several additional error hypotheses, evaluated their likelihood and impact, and prioritized the top three areas of risk:

---

## Additional Relevant Error Hypotheses

1. **Concurrency and Race Conditions** (Technical)
   - Errors caused by simultaneous requests in a distributed environment, leading to data inconsistencies or lost updates.

2. **Distributed System Communication Failures** (Technical)
   - Issues due to inter-service communication disruptions, timeouts, or misconfigurations in Docker containers or network infrastructure.

3. **Security & Compliance Vulnerabilities** (Functional & Technical)
   - Faults arising from inadequate validation, encryption, or storage of sensitive borrower data, leading to potential compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, SOC2) and data breaches.

4. **Session and State Management Errors** (Technical & Functional)
   - Incorrect handling of user session persistence or form state across sessions, potentially causing data loss or duplication.

5. **Fault Tolerance and Resilience Issues** (Technical)
   - Failures in handling backend crashes, container restarts, or database connectivity disruptions.

6. **Data Validation and Integrity Errors** (Functional)
   - Incorrect or insufficient validation rules, allowing invalid data submissions or corruption during storage or transformation.

---

## Prioritization of Top 3 Potential Risk Areas

I evaluated the identified risks based on two key dimensions:

- **Likelihood:** Probability of occurrence given system complexity and feature requirements.
- **Impact:** Consequences for the system, users, and the business if the risk materializes.

| Priority | Risk Area                             | Likelihood | Impact | Justification |
|----------|---------------------------------------|------------|--------|----------------|
| 1        | **Security & Compliance Vulnerabilities** | High       | Critical | Handling sensitive personal and financial data is central to the business. Breaches here can cause severe legal penalties, loss of customer trust, and major reputational damage. The distributed nature of the deployment increases complexity and thus likelihood. |
| 2        | **Concurrency and Race Conditions**        | High       | High    | The system's distributed architecture inherently raises the likelihood of concurrency issues. Race conditions could lead to data integrity problems such as duplicate or lost loan submissions, negatively affecting customer trust and operational reliability. |
| 3        | **Distributed System Communication Failures** | Medium to High | High    | The use of Dockerized containers, distributed Node.js services, and backend interactions increases vulnerability to network, load-balancing, or inter-container communication issues. Communication disruptions could lead to degraded performance, downtime, and lost revenue from incomplete loan applications. |

---

## Recommendations for Risk Mitigation

To proactively address these top-ranked risks, implement the following strategies:

### 1\. Security & Compliance

- Perform regular security audits (penetration testing and vulnerability scanning).
- Implement comprehensive encryption, secure key management, and role-based access controls (RBAC).
- Adopt data privacy and compliance checklists aligning with industry standards (e.g., GDPR, SOC2).

### 2\. Concurrency and Race Conditions

- Conduct intensive load testing with scenarios designed to uncover race conditions.
- Implement distributed locks or transactions to preserve data integrity.
- Include detailed logging and monitoring for detecting and diagnosing concurrency anomalies.

### 3\. Distributed System Communication

- Use resilient communication patterns (e.g., circuit breakers, retries, message queues).
- Implement robust container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) with automated health checks.
- Enhance monitoring, alerting, and tracing to quickly detect and address service disruptions.

By explicitly recognizing, prioritizing, and proactively managing these potential areas of risk, Greenacre Loan Application's development and testing strategy will ensure robust reliability, security, and operational excellence.

## 3. [Define Feature Requirements](../../03-define-feature-requirements-prompt.md)

Below is a concise yet detailed analysis summarizing the **critical features, acceptance criteria, functional areas, edge cases, and potential risk conditions** derived from the provided Epic and User Story. This summary highlights key components to be validated and areas requiring focused, risk-based testing.

---

## 📝 **Summary of Critical Features and Acceptance Criteria**

**Feature Purpose:**  

- Allow borrowers to submit essential data for loan approval.
- Determine eligibility based on specific criteria and assign the appropriate loan program and interest rate.

---

## ✅ **Key Functional Areas for Validation:**

1. **Loan Application Submission**
   - Collection and validation of borrower input data.

2. **Eligibility Determination**
   - Validate borrower and co-borrower FICO scores, property type, LTV, loan amount, loan type, and period against set acceptance criteria.
   - Apply specific eligibility logic per loan program (Jumbo, Conventional, FHA).

3. **Loan Program Assignment Logic**
   - Evaluate multiple potential loan programs and apply precedence (Jumbo > Conventional > FHA).
   - Return correct approval/denial response, program selected, and interest rate.

---

## 🚩 **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:**

Careful attention should be given to boundary values (Boundary Value Analysis) and conditions that lie precisely at the eligibility thresholds:

- **FICO Scores:**
  - Boundary conditions at 300, 520, 620, 660, and 850.
  - Co-borrower "none" versus lowest acceptable score.

- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Percentage:**
  - Edge case precisely at 80% (for Jumbo, Conventional).
  - Edge case precisely at 100% (for FHA).

- **Loan Amount Boundaries:**
  - Precisely at USD 50,000 and USD 418,000.
  - Precisely at USD 1,000,000 (maximum allowed).

- **Loan Period:**
  - Boundary testing for allowed periods: 10, 15, 30, 40 years.
  - FHA program restrictions (only 15 or 30 years).

- **Property Type:**
  - FHA loan excludes Multi-Family and Commercial property types.
  - Jumbo and Conventional exclude Commercial.

- **Loan Type (Fixed vs Adjustable):**
  - FHA allows only Fixed loans, while Jumbo and Conventional accept both Fixed and Adjustable.

---

## ⚠️ **Potential Risks and Areas Requiring Special Attention:**

### 1. **Complex Program Eligibility Logic:**

- Risk of errors or logic flaws given multiple eligibility criteria and overlapping conditions.
- Particular attention required when multiple loan programs overlap; strict adherence to precedence rules must be tested.

### 2. **Incomplete or Incorrect Boundary Validation:**

- Risk of boundary conditions not correctly implemented (e.g., off-by-one errors).
- Extensive boundary value testing critical to ensure eligibility rules are correctly enforced.

### 3. **Data Accuracy and Transformation Risks:**

- Errors from data entry, type conversions, or calculations (e.g., LTV percentage calculations, rounding errors).
- Translation risks exist when transforming form input into backend eligibility logic.

### 4. **Integration and API Response Validation:**

- Risk of incorrect or incomplete API responses for approval or denial statuses.
- Must validate returned values (Approval/Denial, Program, Rate) for correctness under all conditions.

---

## 📌 **Recommended Risk-Based Testing Strategy:**

- **Prioritize Boundary Value Analysis:**  
  Thorough testing of edge conditions (FICO, LTV, Loan Amount, etc.) to identify boundary-related defects early.

- **Employ Equivalence Partitioning:**  
  Segment data into valid/invalid groups for efficient validation of logic conditions.

- **Pairwise Testing of Program Criteria:**  
  Use combinatorial methods to ensure effective coverage of complex combinations of inputs (FICO, LTV, Loan type, etc.).

- **Decision Table Testing:**  
  Clearly map input combinations to expected outputs, ensuring accuracy and completeness of the eligibility and precedence logic.

- **Security and Compliance Checks:**  
  Special attention to secure data handling due to sensitivity of financial information.

---

By explicitly addressing these critical features, boundary conditions, and risk factors, the testing approach will ensure comprehensive coverage, accurate eligibility determination, and robust system reliability for the Greenacre Loan Application app.

- Examine session timeout handling, network disruptions, and browser refreshes.
- Confirm consistent data persistence and application state handling.

##### Charter 3: Security and Sensitive Data Handling

- Explore input validation, data encryption, and sensitive data exposure.
- Validate compliance with security standards and data privacy regulations.

##### Charter 4: Performance and Load Testing (final)

- Test system performance under peak load and high-volume transaction scenarios.
- Identify and report performance bottlenecks and stability issues.

#### Areas for Additional Testing Consideration

- API-level testing for backend services.
- UI accessibility testing.
- Integration tests focusing on end-to-end data flow between front-end and backend.

I've conducted a self-review and identified a few duplications and opportunities for better clarity and completeness. Here's the final consolidated, organized, and refined test suite, ready for integration into your CI/CD pipeline:

The final test suite is now consolidated, organized, and includes comprehensive scenario coverage, robust test data generation, an accurate oracle function, and focused exploratory testing charters. Additional recommendations for areas needing further attention have been included. Let me know if you have any further adjustments or requirements!
