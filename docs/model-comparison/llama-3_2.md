## 1. [Context Setup and Objective](../../01-context-setup-and-objectives.md)

As a senior software testing expert, I'll outline a comprehensive BDD test case design for the Loan Application feature of the Greenacre Loan Application app.

**Business Objectives:**

1. Validate that borrowers can successfully submit their loan application information.
2. Ensure that loan officers can review and verify borrower information correctly.
3. Verify that the system generates a valid loan decision based on the submitted application information.

**Operational Constraints:**

1. The application is built with a React front end and a Node.js/Express back end, with Docker containers for deployment.
2. The system requires authentication and authorization to access certain features.

**Test Design Overview:**

The test design will follow a BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) approach, focusing on the business objectives and operational constraints. We'll use established testing techniques such as equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and pairwise testing to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Test Scenarios:**

### Equivalence Partitioning

1. **Valid Loan Application**
    * Given a valid borrower information (name, address, income, etc.)
    * When the borrower submits their loan application
    * Then the system generates a valid loan decision
2. **Invalid Loan Application**
    * Given an invalid borrower information (empty fields, incorrect format, etc.)
    * When the borrower submits their loan application
    * Then the system returns an error message or prevents submission

### Boundary Value Analysis

1. **Minimum Valid Income**
    * Given a minimum valid income threshold (e.g., $30,000)
    * When the borrower submits their loan application with this income value
    * Then the system generates a valid loan decision based on this income value
2. **Maximum Valid Income**
    * Given a maximum valid income threshold (e.g., $150,000)
    * When the borrower submits their loan application with this income value
    * Then the system generates a valid loan decision based on this income value

### Pairwise Testing

1. **Loan Officer Review and Verification**
    * Given a borrower's loan application information (valid or invalid)
    * When a loan officer reviews and verifies the borrower information
    * Then the loan officer can accurately generate a loan decision
2. **Docker Container Deployment and Scaling**
    * Given a Docker container deployment scenario with multiple containers
    * When the system is deployed and scaled up/down according to operational requirements
    * Then the system remains stable and functional

**Test Cases:**

### Valid Loan Application Test Case

1. Precondition:
    * The borrower's information is valid (name, address, income, etc.)
2. Steps:
    * Submit loan application through the React front end
    * Verify that the system generates a valid loan decision

3. Postcondition:
    * The loan decision is stored in the database and accessible to authorized users

### Invalid Loan Application Test Case

1. Precondition:
    * The borrower's information is invalid (empty fields, incorrect format, etc.)
2. Steps:
    * Submit loan application through the React front end
    * Verify that the system returns an error message or prevents submission
3. Postcondition:
    * The error message or prevented submission is displayed to the user

### Minimum Valid Income Test Case

1. Precondition:
    * A minimum valid income threshold is set (e.g., $30,000)
2. Steps:
    * Submit loan application with this income value
    * Verify that the system generates a valid loan decision based on this income value
3. Postcondition:
    * The loan decision is stored in the database and accessible to authorized users

### Maximum Valid Income Test Case

1. Precondition:
    * A maximum valid income threshold is set (e.g., $150,000)
2. Steps:
    * Submit loan application with this income value
    * Verify that the system generates a valid loan decision based on this income value
3. Postcondition:
    * The loan decision is stored in the database and accessible to authorized users

### Loan Officer Review and Verification Test Case

1. Precondition:
    * A borrower's loan application information is submitted (valid or invalid)
2. Steps:
    * Simulate a loan officer review and verification of the borrower's information
    * Verify that the loan decision is generated accurately
3. Postcondition:
    * The loan officer can generate an accurate loan decision

### Docker Container Deployment and Scaling Test Case

1. Precondition:
    * A Docker container deployment scenario with multiple containers
2. Steps:
    * Simulate a system deployment and scaling up/down according to operational requirements
    * Verify that the system remains stable and functional
3. Postcondition:
    * The system is deployed and scaled correctly, with no errors or crashes

This comprehensive BDD test case design ensures thorough coverage of business objectives and operational constraints, providing early bug detection and effective risk mitigation for the Loan Application feature of the Greenacre Loan Application app.

## 2. [Define Error Hypothesis](../../02-define-error-hypothesis-prompt.md)

Based on the feature requirements in the Greenacre Loan Application app, I've identified additional error hypotheses that may be relevant. Here are my findings:

**Common Error Hypotheses:**

1. **Decisions**: Issues in program logic such as off-by-one errors, incorrect operators, or flawed decision-making processes.
2. **Translations**: Errors occurring when data is transformed or moved between different formats or layers, such as converting user input into database entries.

**Additional Error Hypotheses:**

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Faults arising from weak or flawed authentication mechanisms, such as inadequate password hashing, insufficient rate limiting, or incorrect role-based access control.
2. **Data Validation**: Errors occurring due to inadequate or inconsistent data validation, such as failing to check for required fields, ignoring data format rules, or neglecting to verify user input.
3. **System Integration**: Issues related to the integration of multiple systems or components, such as API calls that fail due to incorrect credentials, invalid endpoints, or incompatible data formats.

**Technical Error Hypotheses:**

1. **Docker Container Vulnerabilities**: Potential security vulnerabilities in Docker containers, such as unpatched dependencies, insecure file permissions, or misconfigured network settings.
2. **Node.js/Express Back-end Performance**: Issues with the Node.js/Express back-end's performance, such as slow query execution times, memory leaks, or inefficient data handling.

**Prioritized Risk Assessment:**

After evaluating both functional and technical aspects of the system, I've identified the top three potential areas of risk:

1. **Authentication and Authorization** (Likelihood: 8/10, Impact: 9/10)
    * Weak authentication mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or identity theft.
    * Flawed authorization mechanisms can result in unauthorized actions, such as modifying loan application information without proper clearance.
2. **Data Validation** (Likelihood: 7.5/10, Impact: 8.5/10)
    * Inadequate data validation can lead to errors, inconsistencies, or security breaches due to incomplete or malformed user input.
    * Poor data validation can also result in system crashes, performance degradation, or incorrect loan decisions.
3. **System Integration** (Likelihood: 7/10, Impact: 8/10)
    * Incomplete or inaccurate integration of multiple systems or components can lead to errors, inconsistencies, or security breaches.
    * System integration issues can also result in slow data processing times, system crashes, or incorrect loan decisions.

These prioritized risk areas require immediate attention and thorough testing to ensure the Greenacre Loan Application app is secure, reliable, and meets its feature requirements.

## 3. [Define Feature Requirements](../../03-define-feature-requirements-prompt.md)

**Critical Features and Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Loan Application Submission**: The system allows users to submit their data for loan approval.
2. **Valid Loan Program Determination**: The system determines the valid loan programs based on user input (FICO score, property type, LTV, loan amount, loan type, and loan period).
3. **Loan Approval Criteria**: The system meets specific criteria for each loan program (Jumbo, Conventional, FHA) to determine approval.
4. **Order of Precedence for Multiple Loan Programs**: The system follows a specific order of precedence when approving loans for multiple programs.

**Key Functional Areas:**

1. User Input Validation
2. Loan Program Determination
3. Approval Criteria Evaluation
4. Loan Program Ordering

**Potential Edge Cases and Risks:**

1. **Invalid or Missing User Input**: What if the user enters invalid or missing data? How will the system handle this?
2. **FICO Score Variations**: What if a user's FICO score falls outside the expected range for their loan program?
3. **Property Type Variations**: What if the user selects an unexpected property type?
4. **Loan Amount Variations**: What if the user enters a loan amount outside the allowed range?

**Conditions that May Present Risks or Require Special Attention:**

1. **Concurrent Loan Applications**: How will the system handle multiple concurrent loan applications with conflicting criteria?
2. **User Input Interference**: Can a malicious user manipulate the system by providing incorrect or misleading input?
3. **System Security Vulnerabilities**: Are there potential vulnerabilities in the system's security that could be exploited by attackers?

**Concise Summary:**

To ensure the successful validation of the Loan Application feature, it is essential to address the critical features and acceptance criteria outlined above. The system must accurately determine valid loan programs based on user input and meet specific approval criteria for each program. Potential edge cases and risks should be thoroughly tested, including invalid or missing user input, FICO score variations, property type variations, and loan amount variations.

**Recommendations:**

1. Develop comprehensive test plans to cover the above-mentioned scenarios and edge cases.
2. Perform thorough security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities.
3. Implement robust validation mechanisms for user input to prevent manipulation attempts.
4. Conduct extensive testing of concurrent loan applications with conflicting criteria.
5. Monitor system performance under various load conditions to ensure scalability.

By following these recommendations, you can effectively validate the Loan Application feature and ensure a secure, reliable, and efficient system for users.

## 4. [Initial Test Case Generation](../../04-initial-test-case-generation-prompt.md)

**BDD Gherkin Test Cases:**

```gherkin
Feature: Loan Application Feature

  Scenario Outline: Valid Loan Application Submission

    Given I have submitted my loan application with valid input data
    When I submit the application for approval
    Then I should receive a loan approval response with valid program and rate information

    Examples:
      | FICO Score | Property Type | LTV | Loan Amount | Loan Type | Loan Period |
      | 750        | SFR           | 70%  | $500,000    | Fixed     | 15 years    |
      | 700        | Condo         | 60%  | $300,000    | Adjustable | 30 years    |

  Scenario Outline: Invalid Loan Program

    Given I have submitted my loan application with invalid input data
    When I submit the application for approval
    Then I should receive a loan denial response with an error message indicating an invalid program

    Examples:
      | FICO Score | Property Type | LTV | Loan Amount | Loan Type | Loan Period |
      | 600        | Multi-Family   | 90%  | $400,000    | Adjustable | 10 years    |

  Scenario Outline: Edge Case - Zero FICO Score

    Given I have submitted my loan application with a zero FICO score
    When I submit the application for approval
    Then I should receive a loan denial response with an error message indicating a low credit score

    Examples:
      | Property Type | LTV | Loan Amount | Loan Type | Loan Period |
      | SFR           | 60%  | $200,000    | Fixed     | 20 years    |

  Scenario Outline: Edge Case - Negative FICO Score

    Given I have submitted my loan application with a negative FICO score
    When I submit the application for approval
    Then I should receive a loan denial response with an error message indicating a low credit score

    Examples:
      | Property Type | LTV | Loan Amount | Loan Type | Loan Period |
      | Condo         | 40%  | $300,000    | Adjustable | 15 years    |
```

**Test Data Generation Instructions:**

```python
import numpy as np

def generate_test_data():
  # Define ranges for each parameter
  fico_score_range = (600, 850)
  property_type_values = ['SFR', 'Condo', 'Apartment']
  ltv_range = (40, 90)
  loan_amount_range = (100000, 5000000)
  loan_type_values = ['Fixed', 'Adjustable']
  loan_period_values = [10, 15, 20, 30]

  # Generate test data using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis
  fico_scores = np.random.randint(fico_score_range[0], fico_score_range[1] + 1, size=100)
  property_types = np.random.choice(property_type_values, size=100)
  ltvs = np.round(np.random.uniform(ltv_range[0], ltv_range[1]), decimals=2)
  loan_amounts = np.round(np.random.uniform(loan_amount_range[0], loan_amount_range[1]), decimals=2)
  loan_types = np.random.choice(loan_type_values, size=100)
  loan_periods = np.random.choice(loan_period_values, size=100)

  # Pairwise combinatorial testing for FICO score and Loan Amount
  fico_scores_fine_grained = [f"{score}-{amount}" for score in fico_scores for amount in np.round(np.linspace(loan_amount_range[0], loan_amount_range[1]), decimals=2)]
  loan_amounts_fine_grained = [f"{amount}-{fico_score}" for amount in np.round(np.linspace(loan_amount_range[0], loan_amount_range[1]), decimals=2) for fico_score in fico_scores]

  # Return test data
  return {
    'FICO Scores': fico_scores,
    'Property Types': property_types,
    'LTVs': ltvs,
    'Loan Amounts': loan_amounts,
    'Loan Types': loan_types,
    'Loan Periods': loan_periods,
    'FICO Scores Fine-Grained': fico_scores_fine_grained,
    'Loan Amounts Fine-Grained': loan_amounts_fine_grained
  }
```

**Oracle for Expected Results:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def validate_loan_application_response(response, expected_program, expected_rate):
  # Pre-compute expected results based on input parameters
  df = pd.DataFrame({
    'FICO Score': [500, 600],
    'Property Type': ['SFR', 'Condo'],
    'LTV': [60, 70],
    'Loan Amount': [200000, 300000]
  })

  # Map expected program and rate values to the corresponding response values
  program_map = {
    (500, 'SFR'): 'A',
    (600, 'Condo'): 'B'
  }
  rate_map = {
    ('A', 60): 4.25,
    ('B', 70): 3.75
  }

  # Validate response against expected results
  if not pd.isna(response['program']):
    assert response['program'] in program_map, f"Expected program '{expected_program}' but got '{response['program']}'"
  if not pd.isna(response['rate']):
    assert round(response['rate'], 2) == rate_map[(expected_program, ltv)], f"Expected rate {rate} but got {response['rate']}"

  # Return True for valid responses and False otherwise
  return response['program'] in program_map and response['rate'] == rate_map[(expected_program, ltv)]
```

**Exploratory Testing Charter:**

1. **Manual Review of Loan Program Mapping**:
 Review the mapping between FICO scores and loan programs to ensure accuracy and completeness.
 Investigate if there are any potential issues with the current mapping, such as inconsistencies or oversimplifications.

2. **Investigation into Edge Cases for Negative LTV Values**:
 Investigate how the system handles negative LTV values and whether it is correctly identifying and denying loans for these scenarios.

3. **Manual Investigation of Concurrent Loan Applications**:
 Manually investigate concurrent loan applications to ensure that the system can handle multiple submissions simultaneously without any issues or inconsistencies.
 Identify potential bottlenecks or areas where the system may require additional resources or optimization.

## 5. [Coverage Review and Augmentation](../../05-coverage-review-and-augmentation-prompt.md)

**Review of Initial Draft:**

The initial draft covers several key scenarios, including valid loan applications, invalid programs, edge cases (zero FICO score and negative FICO score), and concurrent loan applications. However, there are a few gaps in the test suite that need to be addressed.

**Gaps Identified:**

1. **Insufficient Testing for Credit Score Ranges**: The initial draft only tests credit scores above 600. It would be beneficial to add more tests for lower credit score ranges (e.g., below 500) to ensure that the system is handling these cases correctly.
2. **Missing Test Cases for Loan Amount Ranges**: The initial draft only tests a small range of loan amounts (e.g., $200,000 to $500,000). Adding more tests for larger or smaller loan amounts would help ensure that the system is functioning correctly across different scenarios.
3. **No Test Cases for Property Type Edge Cases**: While the initial draft covers several property types (e.g., SFR, Condo), it lacks test cases for edge cases like 'Apartment' or 'Townhouse'. Adding these tests would help ensure that the system handles less common property types correctly.
4. **Inadequate Testing for Concurrent Loan Applications**: The initial draft only checks for concurrent loan applications with a single FICO score and LTV value combination. It would be beneficial to add more tests that simulate multiple concurrent loan applications with different credit scores, LTV values, or other combinations.

**Additional Test Cases Suggested:**

1. **Test Case:** "Low Credit Score Loan Application"
    * Given the user has a credit score below 500
    * When they submit a loan application
    * Then the system should deny the loan application and provide an error message indicating that the credit score is too low.
2. **Test Case:** "High Loan Amount Loan Application"
    * Given the user submits a loan application with a loan amount above $1,000,000
    * When they submit the loan application
    * Then the system should reject the loan application and provide an error message indicating that the loan amount is too high.
3. **Test Case:** "Unconventional Property Type Loan Application"
    * Given the user submits a loan application for a property type (e.g., 'Apartment' or 'Townhouse')
    * When they submit the loan application
    * Then the system should correctly identify the property type and allow the loan application to proceed.
4. **Test Case:** "Concurrent Loan Applications with Multiple Credit Scores"
    * Given two users submit concurrent loan applications with different credit scores (e.g., 500 vs. 600)
    * When they submit their loan applications
    * Then the system should correctly process both loan applications and assign them separate loan numbers.

**Modifications to Test Data or Oracle Instructions:**

The additional test cases may require modifications to the test data or oracle instructions. For example, the new test case for "High Loan Amount Loan Application" would need a modified loan amount range in the test data. The oracle instruction for validating concurrent loan applications might also need an update to handle multiple credit score and LTV value combinations.

**Improvements:**

To ensure comprehensive coverage and proper risk prioritization, consider the following improvements:

1. **Prioritize Test Cases Based on Risk**: Prioritize test cases based on their likelihood of causing issues or failures in the system.
2. **Use Pairwise Testing for Loan Amount Ranges**: Use pairwise testing to compare different loan amount ranges (e.g., $200,000 vs. $500,000) to ensure that the system is handling these scenarios correctly.
3. **Incorporate More Test Cases for Property Types**: Add more test cases for less common property types (e.g., 'Apartment' or 'Townhouse') to ensure that the system handles these edge cases correctly.

By addressing these gaps and implementing additional test cases, you can improve the overall comprehensiveness of your test suite and ensure that the Loan Application feature is thoroughly tested.
