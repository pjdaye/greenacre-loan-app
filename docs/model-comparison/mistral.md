## 1. [Context Setup and Objective](../../01-context-setup-and-objectives.md)

To generate BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) test cases for the Loan Application feature of the Greenacre Loan Application app, we need to focus on both the functional and non-functional aspects of the application. BDD test cases are written in a way that is understandable to non-technical stakeholders, using a format like Gherkin (Given-When-Then).

Here's a structured approach to designing these test cases, incorporating business objectives, operational constraints, and established test design techniques:

### Business Objectives

1. **Accurate Data Collection**: Ensure all necessary information is collected from borrowers.
2. **Efficient Processing**: Loan applications should be processed quickly and accurately.
3. **Compliance**: Adhere to regulatory requirements for loan applications.
4. **User Experience**: Provide a smooth and intuitive user interface for both borrowers and loan officers.

### Operational Constraints

1. **Distributed Environment**: The application runs in Docker containers, so tests should consider containerized deployment.
2. **Scalability**: The system should handle varying loads efficiently.
3. **Security**: Protect sensitive borrower information.

### Test Design Techniques

1. **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divide input data into partitions and test one condition from each partition.
2. **Boundary Value Analysis**: Test the boundaries between partitions.
3. **Pairwise Testing**: Test pairs of input values to cover combinations efficiently.

### BDD Test Cases

#### Feature: Loan Application Submission

##### Scenario 1: Successful Loan Application Submission

- **Given** the borrower is on the loan application page
- **When** the borrower fills in all required fields with valid data
- **And** submits the application
- **Then** the application should be successfully submitted
- **And** the borrower should see a confirmation message

##### Scenario 2: Incomplete Loan Application Submission

- **Given** the borrower is on the loan application page
- **When** the borrower leaves required fields empty
- **And** submits the application
- **Then** the application should not be submitted
- **And** the borrower should see error messages indicating the missing fields

##### Scenario 3: Invalid Data Entry

- **Given** the borrower is on the loan application page
- **When** the borrower enters invalid data in the fields (e.g., negative loan amount)
- **And** submits the application
- **Then** the application should not be submitted
- **And** the borrower should see error messages indicating the invalid data

##### Scenario 4: Boundary Value Testing for Loan Amount

- **Given** the borrower is on the loan application page
- **When** the borrower enters the minimum or maximum allowable loan amount
- **And** submits the application
- **Then** the application should be successfully submitted
- **And** the borrower should see a confirmation message

##### Scenario 5: Pairwise Testing for Loan Type and Term

- **Given** the borrower is on the loan application page
- **When** the borrower selects different combinations of loan type and term
- **And** submits the application
- **Then** the application should be successfully submitted for valid combinations
- **And** the borrower should see error messages for invalid combinations

##### Scenario 6: Security Testing for Sensitive Information

- **Given** the borrower is on the loan application page
- **When** the borrower enters sensitive information (e.g., SSN)
- **And** submits the application
- **Then** the sensitive information should be securely transmitted and stored
- **And** the borrower should see a confirmation message

##### Scenario 7: Scalability Testing

- **Given** multiple borrowers are submitting loan applications simultaneously
- **When** the system is under load
- **Then** all applications should be processed without significant delay
- **And** the system should remain responsive

##### Scenario 8: Compliance Check

- **Given** the borrower is on the loan application page
- **When** the borrower submits the application
- **Then** the application should comply with regulatory requirements
- **And** the borrower should see a confirmation message

### Conclusion

These BDD test cases cover various aspects of the Loan Application feature, ensuring comprehensive test coverage. By incorporating established test design techniques, we can efficiently detect bugs early and mitigate risks associated with the application.

## 2. [Define Error Hypothesis](../../02-define-error-hypothesis-prompt.md)

Based on the specifics of the Greenacre Loan Application app and the feature requirements, here are the top three potential areas of risk, along with their error hypotheses:

### 1. **Data Validation and Integrity**

- **Error Hypotheses**:
  - **Incomplete or Incorrect Data Validation**: Borrowers may enter invalid or incomplete data that is not properly validated, leading to incorrect loan decisions.
  - **Data Corruption During Transmission**: Data may be corrupted or lost during transmission between the front end and back end or when interacting with external systems (e.g., credit bureaus).
- **Impact**: High. Incorrect data can lead to wrong loan decisions, financial losses, and regulatory non-compliance.
- **Likelihood**: High. Data validation is a common area for errors, especially in complex forms.

### 2. **Security and Compliance**

- **Error Hypotheses**:
  - **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Sensitive borrower information may be exposed due to inadequate security measures.
  - **Non-Compliance with Regulations**: The application may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, leading to legal consequences.
- **Impact**: Very High. Security breaches and non-compliance can result in significant financial penalties and loss of trust.
- **Likelihood**: Medium to High. Security is a critical aspect, and compliance requirements are stringent.

### 3. **System Performance and Scalability**

- **Error Hypotheses**:
  - **Performance Degradation Under Load**: The system may become slow or unresponsive under high load, affecting user experience and processing times.
  - **Inadequate Resource Management**: Docker containers may not scale efficiently, leading to resource contention and system failures.
- **Impact**: High. Poor performance can lead to user dissatisfaction and potential loss of business.
- **Likelihood**: Medium. Performance issues are common in distributed systems, especially under varying loads.

### Prioritization

1. **Security and Compliance**: This is the highest priority due to the potential for severe financial and legal consequences.
2. **Data Validation and Integrity**: Ensuring data accuracy is crucial for making correct loan decisions and maintaining regulatory compliance.
3. **System Performance and Scalability**: While important, performance issues may have a lower immediate impact compared to security and data integrity issues.

By focusing on these areas, we can address the most critical risks and ensure the reliability and compliance of the Greenacre Loan Application app.

### 2. Test Data Generation Instructions

Here's a Python script outline to generate test data using equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and pairwise combinatorial testing:

```python
import itertools

# Define equivalence partitions and boundary values
fico_scores = [300, 620, 660, 850]
ltv_values = [0, 80, 100]
loan_amounts = [50000, 418000, 1000000]
loan_periods = [10, 15, 30, 40]
property_types = ["SFR", "Condo", "Townhouse", "Multi-Family", "Commercial"]
loan_types = ["Fixed", "Adjustable"]

# Generate pairwise combinations
test_data = list(itertools.product(fico_scores, ltv_values, loan_amounts, loan_periods, property_types, loan_types))

# Filter test data based on valid combinations
valid_test_data = [
    data for data in test_data
    if (data[0] >= 660 and data[2] >= 418000 and data[3] in [15, 30, 40])  # Jumbo
    or (data[0] >= 620 and data[2] >= 50000 and data[3] in [10, 15, 30, 40])  # Conventional
    or (data[0] >= 300 and data[2] <= 418000 and data[3] in [15, 30])  # FHA
]

# Output the reduced test data set
for i, data in enumerate(valid_test_data, start=1):
    print(f"Test Case {i}: {data}")
```

### 3. Oracle for Expected Results

Here's a pseudocode snippet that acts as an oracle to validate the loan application results:

```python
def calculate_expected_results(fico, co_fico, property_type, ltv, loan_amount, loan_type, loan_period):
    if 660 <= fico <= 850 and (co_fico is None or 620 <= co_fico <= 850) and property_type in ["SFR", "Condo", "Townhouse", "Multi-Family"] and ltv <= 80 and 418000 <= loan_amount <= 1000000 and loan_period in [15, 30, 40]:
        return "Approval", "Jumbo", "Calculate Jumbo Rate"
    elif 620 <= fico <= 850 and (co_fico is None or 520 <= co_fico <= 850) and property_type in ["SFR", "Condo", "Townhouse", "Multi-Family"] and ltv <= 80 and 50000 <= loan_amount <= 1000000 and loan_period in [10, 15, 30, 40]:
        return "Approval", "Conventional", "Calculate Conventional Rate"
    elif 300 <= fico <= 850 and (co_fico is None or 300 <= co_fico <= 850) and property_type in ["SFR", "Condo", "Townhouse"] and ltv <= 100 and 50000 <= loan_amount <= 418000 and loan_type == "Fixed" and loan_period in [15, 30]:
        return "Approval", "FHA", "Calculate FHA Rate"
    else:
        return "Denial", "NA", "NA"

# Example usage
expected_result = calculate_expected_results(700, 650, "SFR", 75, 500000, "Fixed", 30)
print(expected_result)  # Output: ("Approval", "Jumbo", "Calculate Jumbo Rate")
```

### 4. Exploratory Testing Charter

These test assets provide a comprehensive approach to validating the Loan Application feature, ensuring coverage of key functional areas and identified risks.

## 5. [Coverage Review and Augmentation](../../05-coverage-review-and-augmentation-prompt.md)

### Review of Initial Draft and Identified Gaps

The initial draft of test assets covers key functional flows and addresses several critical scenarios. However, there are a few gaps and areas that could benefit from additional test cases and improvements:

1. **Co-Borrower FICO Scenarios**:
   - The current test cases primarily focus on the borrower's FICO score. Additional scenarios should test the impact of the co-borrower's FICO score, especially when it affects eligibility.

2. **Property Type Edge Cases**:
   - The test cases should include more scenarios involving different property types, especially "Commercial," which is not eligible for any loan program.

3. **Loan Amount Boundary Cases**:
   - While some boundary values are tested, additional cases should explore the exact boundaries of loan amounts for different programs, especially around the $418,000 threshold.

4. **Error Handling for Invalid Combinations**:
   - More test cases are needed to validate error handling when invalid combinations of loan parameters are submitted.

5. **Security and Compliance Validation**:
   - The exploratory testing charter mentions security, but specific test cases should be included to validate data protection mechanisms.

### Additional BDD Test Cases

#### Test Case 6: Co-Borrower FICO Impact on Eligibility

```gherkin
Scenario: Co-Borrower FICO Impact on Eligibility
  Given the borrower has a FICO score of 700

  And the loan type is "Adjustable"
  And the loan period is 10 years
  When the borrower submits the loan application
  Then the application should be denied
  And the return values should be "Denial", "NA", "NA"
```

### Recommendations for Improvements

1. **Enhance Test Data Generation**:
   - Include more diverse combinations of co-borrower FICO scores and property types in the test data generation script.
   - Ensure the script covers all boundary values for loan amounts, especially around critical thresholds like $418,000 and $1,000,000.

2. **Expand Oracle Instructions**:
   - Update the oracle to handle cases where the co-borrower's FICO score affects eligibility.
   - Include validation for error messages and handling of invalid combinations.

3. **Security Test Cases**:
   - Add specific test cases to validate data encryption during transmission and storage.
   - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations through automated checks.

4. **Risk Prioritization**:
   - Prioritize test cases that validate data integrity and security, as these have the highest impact on regulatory compliance and user trust.
   - Ensure that boundary value tests are given high priority due to their potential to uncover edge case failures.

By addressing these gaps and incorporating the additional test cases, the test suite will provide more comprehensive coverage of the Loan Application feature, ensuring that all critical functional flows and risk areas are adequately tested.
